# nbtpp2 [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/rutgerbrf/libnbtpp2/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/rutgerbrf/libnbtpp2/commits/master)
A C++14 library for creating, opening and modifying NBT files

## Compiler compatability
Compilation has been tested on GCC and Clang. Support for other compilers is not guaranteed (though merge requests are welcome).  
At the time of writing nbtpp2 compiles on MSVC (I recommend vcpkg for package managament (Boost, zlib)) but the tests do not.
Perhaps you could make them compile with some less aggressive compiler flags.
